# design-pattern

This is a simple repo to demonstrate the design patterns in **TypeScript** and **Go**.

## Introduction

As per the [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns), 
design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. 
Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

Therefore, this repo demonstrates the following design patterns I find useful in my day-to-day coding:
- Creational Patterns
  - Singleton
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
- Structural Patterns
  - Adapter
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Proxy
- Behavioral Patterns
  - Observer
  - Strategy

Each design pattern is implemented in both TypeScript and Go.
I hope this repo will be useful to you as well.

## TypeScript

To run the TypeScript code, navigate to the TypeScript directory.
```bash
cd Typescript
```

Install the dependencies.
```bash
bun install
```

Run the TypeScript code.
```bash
bun run index.ts
```

## Go

To run the Go code, navigate to the Go directory.
```bash
cd Go
```

Run the Go code.
```bash
go run main.go
```

## Thoughts
As a Software Engineer, writing and debugging code is part of my daily routing.
I tried to write the best code I can, but I always find myself writing the same code over and over again.

I found that many software engineers find design patterns unnecessary, I agree with them to some extent.
Design patterns may not be the best solution for every problem, but they give you a taste of how to solve a problem in a structured way.

As I try to implement the design patterns in this repo and understand different open-source projects, I found that design patterns are useful in many cases.

I think it's not about using design patterns in every module of your code, but I always find it useful when I'm trying to build something 
maintainable, scalable, and testable.

I hope this may help someone who is quite new to this industry and trying to understand the design patterns.
